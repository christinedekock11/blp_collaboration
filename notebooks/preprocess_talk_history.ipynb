       " \"Alfie, you would be best to post at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Andy Bennett (musician)]], where the future of the page is being discussed. This page needs more reliable references to confirm that Bennett is notable ''independently'' of his role in OCS. Of course, the OCS article has information on him, and will continue to do so. If he is found non-notable independent of the band, [[Andy Bennett (musician)]] would redirect to Ocean Colour Scene, so interested readers would still find information on him. I don't know if the OCS article has information on how the band members have fared outwith the band, but it could be added if not. It needs to be established that Bennett meets [[WP:MUSICBIO]] or [[WP:GNG]] inependent of his work in OCS. If he is only notable for his work in OCS, then his information should only be in that article. I believe all members of OCS have their articles tagged as of dubious notability independent of the band. The other bands he has been in do not seem to be notable, and lots of professional musicians are successful, without reaching the level of [[WP:NOTABILITY]] required for the inclusion of an individual article in an encyclopaedia. I do hope some of that is helpful; good luck.. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 19:22, 30 December 2014 (UTC)\",\n",
